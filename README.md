# Web Portfolio

Welcome to my web portfolio!

This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Development was sped up by utilizing the Bootstrap framework.

If you have any questions/concerns feel free to message.

This project is excellent for an intro to cs course, intro to web development course, or those wanting to lean web development.

Drafted by Andrew Euler.
